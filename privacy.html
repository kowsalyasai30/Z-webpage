<h2>What is Personal Data?</h2>
<p>When we use the term “personal data” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual within the context of the individual’s role as a member of our personnel or a related person. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual. Where we maintain deidentified data, we will maintain and use the data in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the data except as required or permitted by law.
</p>
<h2>Our Collection and Use of Personal Data</h2>
<p>In connection with an individual’s role as a member of our personnel, we may collect the following professional or employment-related personal data:

Contact Information: such as full name, email address (personal and work), home address, business address, telephone number and emergency contact information.

Equal Employment Opportunity Information: such as age, race, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, sex, gender identity or transgender status, sexual orientation, religion, disability or accommodation request, or marital or veteran status when an individual chooses to provide it, but it will not be used in employment-related decisions unless specifically permitted by law.

Security Information: such as work-related accounts and passwords, technical details about the individual’s use of work-related devices and information systems (including, for example, device, logs, analytics data, IP address, and general location information derived from such IP address), the content of communications sent through work-related devices and information systems, access to physical and electronic work-related locations, audio recordings and photographs, videos and other visual images of the individual.

Other Work-Related Information: We also collect any personal data the individual chooses to share with us, the individual makes publicly available or we receive from a third party in connection with the individual’s work for us, a grievance the individual is involved in, an agreement the individual enters into with us or additional roles the individual takes on as a part of our organization.

Inferences: We may generate inferences or predictions about personnel and their abilities, interests, or preferences based on the other personal data we collect and the interactions we have with them.

Although we often collect the personal data described above directly from the individual, we also collect this information from supervisors, colleagues, customers, vendors, publicly available sources, and other third parties the individual may interact with as a member of our personnel. In addition, we may also collect this information through service providers and other third parties that collect it on our behalf, such as background check providers, communications providers, payroll providers, and benefits providers.
